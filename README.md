# Android-Apps

This is basically a code dump of everything I worked on for my Android Mobile Computing class. 
For the final project, my team partner and I created Jukebox, which allowed users to share music to one master phone
who could then plug in his/her phone into the audiojack for road trips. We added in functionality so users can vote to skip
songs in the playlist. This was done through Wifi P2P to ensure super fast transfer speeds and better connectivity.
